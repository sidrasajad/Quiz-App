# Quiz App 

The Quiz App is a dynamic, user-friendly web application built using ES6 JavaScript. It allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, and provides feedback at the end of the quiz. The app uses modern ES6 features such as classes, modules, arrow functions, template literals, array methods, and destructuring to ensure clean, modular, and efficient code.
